# Purpose
- Remain healthy
- Spend time with my wife and kids
- Create and maintain strong relationships
- Have control over how I spend my time
- Do work I enjoy and am proud of

# Watcher
Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post.
