# interviewprep
A [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) markdown vault containing all of the study notes I made whilst prepping to interview in Summer 2021. Accompanying blog post explaining the rationale behind this [here](https://adambennett.dev/2021/11/on-interviewing/). This isn't intended to be comprehensive - more of an example of how to use Obsidian effectively. If you see anything obviously incorrect though, please do open a PR.

To view these files correctly, install Obsidian and import the root folder as a vault. View `Intro.md` for more info and a table of contents.

You can of course view these files here on GitHub, but much of the formatting (LaTeX, Mermaid) isn't supported and will look weird.
